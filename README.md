# Beej Rustified

This repo contains rustified versions of
[Beej's Guide to Network Programming sample programs](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/).

## Constraints

- _As much as possible_, the examples will use Rust's standard library for all
network-related routines.
- The examples doesn't have to implement a 1-1 network library call with the
C implementation. It does have to behave identically feature-wise.

## TODO
